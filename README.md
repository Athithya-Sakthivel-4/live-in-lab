# 🧒 Child Recovery Platform 🇮🇳

This is an AI-powered **child recovery prototype** for identifying missing children in India using **facial recognition**. The system allows users to upload images and check if they match any missing children stored in the database.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Face Recognition** using DeepFace  
✅ **Store & Manage Missing Children** in an SQLite database  
✅ **Search for Missing Children** by uploading a photo  
✅ **Easy Database Management** with Makefile commands  
✅ **User-Friendly Web Interface**

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.8). Then, set up the environment:
```bash
make setup
```
This will create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

### **2️⃣ Initialize Database**
To create the SQLite database and insert sample children:
```bash
make init-db
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Application**
To start the Flask web application:
```bash
make run
```
The web interface will be accessible at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## 🖼️ Adding New Missing Children

To manually add a new missing child:
```bash
make add
```
It will prompt for:
- **Child Name**
- **Child Age**
- **Image Path** (relative path to the image file)

Example:
```
Enter Child Name: Rahul
Enter Child Age: 12
Enter Image Path: database_images/rahul.jpg
✅ Child added successfully!
```

## 🔍 Searching for a Missing Child

To verify if a child is missing:
```bash
make verify
```
- Enter the **image path** of the child to check.  
- The system will search for a match in the database.

Example:
```
Enter image path to check: uploads/test_child.jpg
Result: ❌ No match found.
```
